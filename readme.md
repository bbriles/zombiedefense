# Zombie Defense

## Overview

Zombie defense is a rather simple and silly game where you defend yourselves and other hapless victims from the ravaging horde of zombies. 
It is a two player-cooperative game built with the intention of being played on my arcade cabinet at home with my kids.

## Insallation
I dunno, I haven't actually deployed it yet.

## Controls
Uses 8-way joystick to move, 1 button to fire and another to activate/pick-up objects.
